                <p class="answer">28 By Sam Wood is an online training and nutrition program designed for anybody, anywhere. 28 gives you an
                easy-to-follow structure to that can fit into even the busiest of lives. You don’t need a gym, you don’t need equipment…
                you just need a phone and 28 minutes a day.
                
                The philosophy behind my program is: keep it simple. Move differently every day for 28 minutes, eat real food, take time
                out when you need it and surround yourself with the support you need.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p class="answer">We believe that real food is the best food. Real food comes out of the ground, off a tree, or from an animal (of course,
                this depends on your personal preference). At 28, our food philosophy is JERF, Just Eat Real Food. This means our
                recipes are packed full of delicious whole foods and nutritious ingredients.
                
                Our focus is on an abundance of vegetables with every meal (yes, even breakfast!), quality protein, good fats and
                whole-food carbohydrates. We don’t believe in restrictive eating, so you will still find favourites like bread, pasta
                and pizzas in our meals (even healthy burgers). Balance is one of the most important nutritional principles – we believe
                food is there to nourish, share and enjoy.</p>

                <p class="question">Do I have to calorie count?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p class="answer">For years we have been told that monitoring calorie input and output is the only way to get results when it comes to
                losing weight. This way of thinking mean that many of us were spending unnecessary hours at the gym, and/or eating a
                dangerously low amount of food. People started eating food with the least amount of calories (think lite or low fat
                foods) without any consideration for the quality of food that they are eating.
                
                28 meals are based around an abundance of predominantly non-starchy vegetables complimented by quality protein and good
                fats so it would be very difficult for someone to overdo calories (plus we keep the meal plans in check to ensure this
                doesn’t happen!).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p class="answer">Signing up to our program gives you access to a huge range of guided workouts that you can do from home, whenever it
                fits in with your schedule. You’ll have HIIT, Cardio, Pilates, Strength and Yoga workouts to choose from, each of which
                is guided by myself or one of our expert 28 trainers. There is no set number of workouts that you need to do each week,
                however for optimal fitness I always recommend ‘getting your body moving’ at least once a day.</p>

                and Pescatarian. We also have a collection of recipes that are vegan, however when it comes to the meal plan program you
                may have to supplement some ingredients for plant-based options. You have full control to swap out recipes for
                alternative options throughout your time in the challenge – and there are thousands to choose from! Trust us, you will
                not go hungry on our meal plans.</p>
